### Transactions

A user can add a transaction specifying the amount of LBP and USD dollars and the type of transaction(buy or sell). They
can also see the list of transactions they added previously.

### Trades

A user can post a trade offer specifying the amount of USD dollars, the rate they are asking for, and the type of
transaction(buy or sell). Once it is added, we remove the amount specified by the user to make sure they can only add
trades as long as they have enough balance in their account. Other users interested in the offer can make the trade, if
they have the amount requested, with a single button click after which we automatically update the balances of both
users.
